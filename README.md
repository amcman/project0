# project0
This is the first project of MCIT 595

In this course I hope to better my understanding of how software and hardware come together to create a seamless computing experience. I also wish to better understand the C programming language and the structure of operating systems.


Setting up my git repo and installing vagrant was a success! I did not encounter any issues.
